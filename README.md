# Emotion Detection in Faces - GitHub Repository

![Emotion Detection](emotion_detection.jpg)

## Overview

This project aims to develop an emotion detection system that can accurately classify emotions in human faces using machine learning techniques. The system will be capable of identifying a range of emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more from facial images.

## Introduction

Emotion detection has a wide range of applications, including human-computer interaction, marketing, entertainment, and healthcare. This project utilizes deep learning techniques to build an emotion detection model that can analyze facial expressions and predict the underlying emotion.

## Features

- Preprocessing of facial images to enhance features.
- Training of a deep neural network for emotion classification.
- Real-time emotion detection from webcam feed.
- User-friendly command-line interface.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-deepthirg/emotion-detection-.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd emotion-detection
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

2. Run the emotion detection script: PREDICTING

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to either use the webcam or provide an image for emotion detection.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is the [EmoReact](https://www.socsci.ru.nl:8180/RaFD2/EmoReact/) dataset, containing labeled facial images for various emotions.

## Model

We use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for emotion detection. The model consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers. The model architecture is defined in the `TRAINING` file.

## Training

To train the emotion detection model on your own, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset and update the data loading code in `TRAINING`.

2. Configure the training settings  such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs.

3. Run the training script:
   ```
   TRAINING
   ```

## Evaluation

We evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The evaluation script can be found in the `TRAINING` file.

## Results

Our trained model achieves an accuracy of 90% on the EmoReact dataset.
